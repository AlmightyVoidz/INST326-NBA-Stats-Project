# INST326-Team-Project

For Project 3 
This project builds off our earlier system by applying the advanced OOP concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, and composition. This system evaluates NBA player statistics entered by the user and generates a rating from:

Excellent-5, Good-4, OK-3, Bad-2, Terrible-1
The system supports Five NBA stat categories:

Points Per Game

Shooting Percentage

Blocks/Steals Per Game

Assists Per Game 

Rebounds Per Game
