# INST326-Team-Project

For Project 2
This project is basically a mini information-retrieval system built with Python classes.You are able to add documents, and the program automatically builds an inverted index behind the scenes, and then you can search up any term you want.
On top of that, it can generate reports so you can actually see what’s going on inside the index — top terms, document stats, and much more.

For Project 3 
This project builds off our earlier system by applying the advanced OOP concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, and composition. This system evaluates NBA player statistics entered by the user and generates a rating from:

Excellent-5, Good-4, OK-3, Bad-2, Terrible-1
The system supports Five NBA stat categories:

Points Per Game

Shooting Percentage

Blocks/Steals Per Game

Assists Per Game 

Rebounds Per Game
